>One of the common types of attacks faced by SMBs comes in phishing, which targets the
employee. This type of attack aims to deceive an employee into thinking an email is sent by an
owner, customer, or vendor and could contain a link or attachment infected with malware. When
the employee opens the attachment or clicks on the link, malware or other malicious software
forms could be introduced into their computer (Huang et al., 2018).
